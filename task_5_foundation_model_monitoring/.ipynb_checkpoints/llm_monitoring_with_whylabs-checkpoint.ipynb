    "LangKit is an open-source text metrics toolkit for monitoring language models. It offers an array of methods for extracting relevant signals from the input and/or output text, which are compatible with the open-source data logging library whylogs.\n",

    "# Security and Privacy\n",
    "Monitoring for security and privacy in Language Model (LLM) applications helps ensuring the protection of user data and preventing malicious activities. Several approaches can be employed to strengthen the security and privacy measures within LLM systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One approach is to measure text similarity between prompts and responses against known examples of jailbreak attempts, prompt injections, and LLM refusals of service. By comparing the embeddings generated from the text, potential security vulnerabilities and unauthorized access attempts can be identified. This helps in mitigating risks and contributes to the LLM operation within secure boundaries. In langkit, text similarity calculation between prompts/responses and known examples of jailbreak attempts, prompt injections, and LLM refusals of service can be done through the themes module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having a prompt injection classifier in place further enhances the security of LLM applications. By detecting and preventing prompt injection attacks, where malicious code or unintended instructions are injected into the prompt, the system can maintain its integrity and protect against unauthorized actions or data leaks. In langkit, prompt injection detection metrics can be computed through the injections module and proactive_injection_detection module.\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are known for their ability to generate non-factual or nonsensical statements, more commonly known as “hallucinations.” This characteristic can undermine trust in many scenarios where factuality is required, such as summarization tasks, generative question answering, and dialogue generations. In langkit, hallucination detection metrics can be computed through the hallucination module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important aspect of security and privacy monitoring involves checking prompts and responses against regex patterns designed to detect sensitive information. These patterns can help identify and flag data such as credit card numbers, telephone numbers, or other types of personally identifiable information (PII). In langkit, regex pattern matching against pattern groups can be done through the regexes module."
