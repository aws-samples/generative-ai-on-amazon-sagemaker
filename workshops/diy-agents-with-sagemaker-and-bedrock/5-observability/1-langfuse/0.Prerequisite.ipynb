    "# [Observability with Langfuse](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/transform-large-language-model-observability-with-langfuse)\n",
    "\n",
    "[Langfuse](https://langfuse.com/) is an open-source observability and analytics platform designed specifically for LLM applications. Langfuse helps you track, monitor, and analyze your LLM application's performance, costs, and behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Langfuse, you can:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Track and analyze LLM interactions and their associated costs\n",
    "- Monitor model performance and latency\n",
    "- Debug production issues with detailed tracing\n",
    "- Evaluate output quality and model behavior\n",
    "- Collect user feedback and ground truth data and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll walk through creating a Langfuse account, setting up a project, generating API credentials, and configuring custom model definitions. This will prepare us to start tracing our LLM applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important**: for the sake of this workshop, we will not be creating a custom server running LangFuse, and will instead use the [SaaS version](https://cloud.langfuse.com/) of the product. If you want, you can learn how to host your own LangFuse server on [Langfuse doc](https://langfuse.com/self-hosting), or using this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/deploy-langfuse-on-ecs-with-fargate/).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by **creating your account on [LangFuse Cloud](https://cloud.langfuse.com/)**\n",
    "1. Create a **New Organization** and enter an organization name, for example `AnyCompany`. Skip the Invite Members step.\n",
    "1. Enter a **name** for the new project and click **Create**.\n",
    "1. Note down the **Secret Key**, **Public Key** and **Host** on your computer. Note you can also find the credentials in the *Settings -> API Keys* page.\n",
    "1. We will be using the `langfuse` SDK to achieve our goals of obtaining traces and logs for our agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracing\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get to tracing. Start by installing the required libraries:"
