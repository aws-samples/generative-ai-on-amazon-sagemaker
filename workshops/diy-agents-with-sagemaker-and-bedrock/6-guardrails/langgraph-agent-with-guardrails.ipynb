   "source": "# LangGraph Meal Planning Agent with Bedrock Guardrails\n\n## 🎯 Overview\n\nThis notebook demonstrates an **AI-powered meal planning system** that generates personalized recipe recommendations while ensuring food safety through **AWS Bedrock Guardrails**. The solution uses a multi-agent architecture built with LangGraph to process user preferences, generate recipes, and find cooking tutorials.\n\n## 📋 Solution Description\n\nThe meal planning application analyzes natural language requests from users (e.g., \"I want a vegan dish under 20 minutes\") and generates three customized recipes complete with ingredients, instructions, and YouTube cooking tutorials. To ensure user safety, AWS Bedrock Guardrails actively monitor and block potentially harmful content related to:\n\n- 🚫 Unsafe food handling practices\n- 🔥 Dangerous cooking methods\n- 🥜 Allergen negligence\n- 🍖 Raw/undercooked high-risk foods\n- 💊 False medical dietary claims\n- ⚖️ Extreme dieting practices\n- 🗑️ Spoiled food consumption\n\n## 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture\n\nThe system employs three specialized AI agents working in sequence:\n\n### 1. **Meal Preference Analyzer Agent**\n- **Input:** Natural language user request\n- **Output:** Structured JSON with dietary preferences, restrictions, allergies, cuisine preferences, and cooking constraints\n- **Model:** AWS Bedrock Nova Pro with guardrails\n- **Purpose:** Converts free-form text into standardized format for recipe generation\n\n### 2. **Recipe Generator Agent**\n- **Input:** Structured JSON preferences\n- **Output:** Three diverse recipes in markdown format (H2 headings for titles)\n- **Tools:** DuckDuckGo search for recipe inspiration\n- **Model:** AWS Bedrock Nova Pro with guardrails\n- **Purpose:** Generates safe, customized recipes following all dietary requirements\n\n### 3. **Video Finder Agent**\n- **Input:** Extracted recipe titles (list)\n- **Output:** YouTube cooking tutorial links for each recipe\n- **Tools:** YouTube search API\n- **Model:** AWS Bedrock Nova Pro with guardrails\n- **Purpose:** Finds relevant cooking videos to help users prepare meals\n\n## 🛡️ Guardrail Components\n\nThe guardrail system consists of four primary components that work together to ensure content safety:\n![alt text](guardrails-1.png)\n| Component | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| Topic Policy | Filters input based on seven denied topics, preventing processing of prohibited content categories. |\n| Content Filters | Analyzes content for hate speech, violence, or misconduct, blocking any content that violates these standards. |\n| Word Filters | Scans for 17 specific food safety terms to ensure recipe-related content adheres to safety guidelines. |\n| PII Protection | Anonymizes personally identifiable information to protect user privacy and comply with data protection regulations. |\n\n\n## 🛡️ Multi-Agent Workflow with Guardrail Protection\n\nThe multi-agent system consists of three specialized agents:\n\n![alt text](guardrails-agents.png)\n\n| Agent | Role | Function |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Preference Analyzer | Agent 1 | Converts natural language requests into structured JSON format for further processing. |\n| Recipe Generator | Agent 2 | Creates three recipes based on user preferences and performs relevant searches. |\n| Video Finder | Agent 3 | Searches YouTube for tutorial videos related to the generated recipes. |\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 🔒 Guardrail Intervention Points\n\nGuardrails protect users at **every stage** of the workflow:\n\n| Stage | Protection | Example Blocked Content |\n|-------|-----------|-------------------------|\n| **User Input** | Scans incoming requests | \"How to prepare raw chicken without cooking\" |\n| **Agent Output** | Monitors generated recipes | \"Leave meat at room temperature overnight\" |\n| **Tool Calls** | Validates search queries | Blocks queries for dangerous techniques |\n\n## 🌟 Key Features\n\n✅ **Food Safety First** - Guardrails block 7 categories of dangerous food advice  \n✅ **Personalized Recipes** - Respects dietary restrictions, allergies, and preferences  \n✅ **Multi-Agent Orchestration** - LangGraph coordinates three specialized agents  \n✅ **Visual Learning** - YouTube videos help users follow recipes step-by-step  \n✅ **Real-time Protection** - Guardrails monitor every AI interaction  \n\n---\n\nLet's build a safe and intelligent meal planning assistant! 👨‍🍳"
