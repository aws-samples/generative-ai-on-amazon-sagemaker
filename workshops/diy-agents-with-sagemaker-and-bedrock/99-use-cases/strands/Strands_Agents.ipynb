    "# Building an AI agent with Strands Agents SDK and Amazon Bedrock\n",

    "\n",
    "Building an AI agent with Strands Agents SDK is a straightforward process that centers around three fundamental components: a model, tools, and a prompt. To create an agent, developers first need to define these elements in their code. The model can be selected from various supported options, including Amazon Bedrock models with tool use and streaming capabilities, Anthropic's Claude model family, Ollama for local development, or other providers through LiteLLM. For tools, developers can choose from thousands of published Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers or utilize Strands' 20+ pre-built example tools for tasks like file manipulation, API requests, and AWS API interactions. Any Python function can be transformed into a tool using the Strands @tool decorator. The prompt consists of both a natural language prompt defining the agent's task and a system prompt providing general instructions and desired behavior. Once these components are defined, the agent operates in a loop, interacting with its model and tools until the task is completed. The Strands agentic loop leverages the advanced capabilities of modern LLMs to reason, plan, and select tools appropriately. To learn more about Strands Agents, head over to the announcement blog.\n",
