In this notebook, we cover the foundational capabilities needed to develop an automated LLM fine-tuning and evaluation pipeline.

She experiences this during activities like coughing or sneezing but doesn't leak at night. She undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. The question is asking what cystometry would most likely reveal about her residual volume and detrusor contractions.\\n\\nFirst, I need to break down the information given. She's 61, so she's of postmenopausal age, which might be relevant because urinary issues can change after menopause. She has involuntary urine loss, which makes me think of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). SUI is common in women, especially after menopause, and it's typically due to weak pelvic muscles or urethral issues.\\n\\nShe mentions the loss happens during activities like coughing or sneezing, which are activities that can increase intra-abdominal pressure, leading to urethral sphincter failure. Also, she doesn't leak at night, which is interesting because that suggests it's not a mixed incontinence case (where she might have both stress and urge incontinence). If she didn't leak at night, it's more likely purely stress incontinence.\\n\\nShe undergoes a gynecological exam and a Q-tip test. I'm not exactly sure what the Q-tip test entails, but I think it's a physical exam maneuver where the provider inserts a Q-tip catheter into the urethra and asks the patient to cough or bear down. If the catheter doesn't stay in the urethra (i.e., it pops out), it suggests urethral sphincter deficiency, which is a sign of SUI.\\n\\nSo, if the Q-tip test shows that the catheter doesn't stay in the urethra, that would support a diagnosis of SUI. Now, moving on to cystometry, which is a more detailed diagnostic tool. Cystometry involves inserting a catheter into the bladder and filling it with fluid to measure how much the patient can hold before needing to urinate (the capacity), and it also assesses the detrusor muscle contractions.\\n\\nIn SUI, the main issue is the inability to prevent the urethral sphincter from opening when there's increased intra-abdominal pressure. On cystometry, this would show that the patient has a small residual volume in the bladder because they can't hold their urine under stress. Additionally, during the filling phase, the\"}"
