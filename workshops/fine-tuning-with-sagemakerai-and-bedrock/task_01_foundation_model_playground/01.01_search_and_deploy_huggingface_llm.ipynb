       "'The key point in this question is that the 3-week-old infant has **late-onset perinatal meningitis** and the **CSF culture shows gram-positive bacilli**. This clinical scenario is highly suggestive of **Listeria monocytogenes**, which is a known cause of late-onset meningitis in neonates and young infants.\\n\\nTo answer the question:  \\n**What characteristic of this bacterium can specifically differentiate it from other bacterial agents?**\\n\\nThe most specific and distinguishing feature of *Listeria monocytogenes* among gram-positive bacilli is:\\n\\n汨 **It is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can grow at 37ﾂｰC and also at 4ﾂｰC (even in refrigerated environments), and it is capable of growing in the presence of oxygen (aerobic growth) and in the absence of oxygen (anaerobic growth).**\\n\\nBut more importantly, **the most specific and clinically relevant differentiating characteristic** is:\\n\\n笨 **It is the only gram-positive bacillus that can grow at 4ﾂｰC and is capable of intracellular growth within phagocytic cells (such as macrophages and monocytes).**\\n\\nHowever, the **most specific and diagnostic feature** that differentiates *Listeria monocytogenes* from other gram-positive bacilli (like *Bacillus* species or *Streptococcus* spp.) in the context of neonatal meningitis is:\\n\\n汨 **It is the only gram-positive bacillus that is capable of growing at 4ﾂｰC and is intracellular, and it produces a unique enzyme called listeriolysin O (LLO), which allows it to escape the phagosome into the cytoplasm.**\\n\\nBut the **most clinically useful and specific differentiating characteristic** in a diagnostic context is:\\n\\n笨 **It is the only gram-positive bacillus that can grow at 4ﾂｰC and is a facultative intracellular pathogen.**\\n\\nThis is particularly important because:\\n\\n- *Listeria monocytogenes* is the **only gram-positive bacillus** that can grow at **4ﾂｰC** (unlike *Bacillus* species, which do not grow well at cold temperatures).\\n- It is also **resistant to phagocytic killing** due to listeriolysin O, which allows it to survive and multiply inside host cells.\\n\\nTherefore, the **specific characteristic** that differentiates *Listeria monocytogenes* from other bacterial agents (especially other gram-positive bacilli) in this context is:\\n\\n汨 **Its ability to grow at 4ﾂｰC and its intracellular pathogenicity.**\\n\\n笨 Final Answer:  \\n**The ability to grow at 4ﾂｰC and its intracellular growth within host cells (particularly macrophages) is the specific characteristic that differentiates *Listeria monocytogenes* from other gram-positive bacilli.**'"
